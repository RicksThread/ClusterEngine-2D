# ClusterEngine-2D
## Project overview
An attempt to create a very small 2d game engine for learning purposes.
It uses GLFW as context and window manager and 
GLAD as a way to access the entry points for the functions of openGL's higher versions.

### What it offers:
 - It offers a very simple physics API (terribly optmized) with:
   - 2D convex colliders along with events such as onTrigger and onCollide using the SAT algorithm
   - Simple rigidbodies.
 - A simple component system:
 - A high level rendering system through the component one (I.E SpriteRenderer)


### What it does not offer:
 - Graphical editor
 - everything else for a great Game Engine

## Documentation
I have no plan in implementing a documentation, as it is mostly a project for fun and to challenge myself

## Screenshots
